## End-to-End Data Analytics Project (Python & PostgreSQL)

# 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from data ingestion and cleaning in Python to querying insights from a PostgreSQL database using SQL.

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas)
- PostgreSQL
- psycopg2
- Jupyter Notebook 
- SQL

# 📂 Project Steps

1. Data Collection  
   - imported the dataset from for analysis.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Renamed columns  
   - Standardized data types using pandas

3. Database Integration  
   - Connected to PostgreSQL using psycopg2  
   - Created tables and exported cleaned data to the database

4. SQL Analysis  
   - Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions  
   - Performed aggregations, joins, and filtering

# ✅ Outcomes
- Gained insights such as top-selling products, monthly sales trends, and regional performance.
- Demonstrated ability to manage data pipelines and work with relational databases.
